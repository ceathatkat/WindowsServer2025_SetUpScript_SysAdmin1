NSSA221 Systems Administration I
Lab 06: Apache, Email, Logging, and Cron
INTRODUCTION
This lab is the coup de grâce of all labs! So far, you have learned how to manage users, devices, file systems, storage and
version control. In this lab, you will explore services that are found in many enterprise environments as well as smaller
organizations, web and email. We will also look at approaches to remote logging and managing system tasks using the
Cron utility.
L AB SUMMARY
In this lab, you will use Windows 10 as the mail server, and Rocky Linux for a web server. The lab has three parts; the
first part will have you configure an Apache web server. Once the server is running, you will create virtual hosts and
produce a self-signed certificate to encrypt HTTP communications. Part 2 will explore the protocols and roles of various
devices involved in email communication. The final part will give you experience running cron jobs and centralized
logging in your environment.
GOALS
At the end of this lab, you will...
• Have a better understanding of the role and function of a web server in an enterprise environment.
• Have experience creating virtual hosts on a web server.

ACTIVITIES


Activity 1 – Deploying a Basic Web Server
For this activity, you will be installing and configuring the Apache web service on the Rocky Linux 8 virtual machine in
your environment. Feel free to “scale out,” another virtual machine or use an existing Rocky VM in your deployment.
a. The Rocky Linux 8 should be assigned the same hostname from Lab 1 and have a DNS record in the DNS server. If
you “scaled out,” a new deployment, make sure to update DNS and assign a hostname to the new virtual machine.
b. In the previous lab, you had exercises involving SELinux, be mindful of the SELinux status of the deployment. You
can edit the configuration file and set SELinux to permissive, or use the setenforce command to set it to
permissive during runtime.
c. Install the required packages using the following command.
d. Start the httpd service (refer to the systemctl cheat sheet for help) and verify the installation by starting the httpd
service and entering “localhost” into a web browser to bring up the default Apache webpage (Figure 1).
e. Enable the HTTP service so that it starts when the system boots.
Figure 1 – Default Apache Webpage
e. To view the Apache documentation, use the following URL https://httpd.apache.org/docs/ (Figure 2).

Activity 2 – Creating Virtual Web Servers
In an enterprise environment, it is unlikely that you will have multiple servers, physical or virtual, for each website.
Instead, you will find a dedicated Apache server hosting many sites through virtual web servers. This activity is designed
to introduce you to this concept by having you create three sites on a single (and in your case, a virtual) Apache
webserver. One of the sites will be the default site, and the other two will be virtual host sites. The examples in these
instructions use the following sites.
• www.gpavks.com
• starlord.gpavks.com
• gamora.gpavks.com
a. Edit the httpd.conf file by adding a directive to allow access to the virtual hosts. In the example provided, the virtual
hosts are in the /www/virtualhosts/ directory; you may choose a different directory; and if you do, make sure to
check the permissions. We will worry about creating the directories later, for now; edit the httpd.conf file by adding
the following directive. Figure 4 provides an example of an entry.
Figure 4 – Example Directive Entry in the httpd.conf File.
b. Create the necessary configuration files for each of the virtual hosts in the /etc/httpd/conf.d directory. To keep
track of things, I recommend you name the file so that it associates to the site. For example, for
“startlord.gpavks.com,” I have named it “starlord.gpavks.com.conf”. Yes, all I am doing is using the URL and adding
“.conf” at the end. Trust me, when you have several virtual hosts, it is much easier to manage them when the
configuration files are clearly descriptive.
Arcoraci 5 Spring 2245
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerAdmin grock@gpavks.com
DocumentRoot /www/virtualhosts/starlord.gpavks.com
ServerName starlord.gpavks.com
ErrorLog logs/starlord.gpavks.com-error.log
</VirtualHost>
$ mkdir –p /www/virtualhosts/starlord.gpavks.com
Please Note: The “ServerAdmin” statement is not necessary, it is purely an exercise in simulating a real-world entry,
however, the other entries are required for the lab.
See Figure 5 for a sample entry. Below is a summary of each statement in the file.
• The VirtualHost directive identifies the IP and port. The asterisk symbol, allows access through all interfaces
followed by a colon and the HTTP well-known port, port 80.
• The ServerAdmin statement provides the email address of the administrator responsible for the site.
• The DocumentRoot statement is the location of the index.html file for the site.
• The ServerName statement is the virtual host server name for the site.
• The ErrorLog statement is where the error logs for each site are located.
Figure 5 – Example Virtual Host Entry
c. Create the directory path to point to the index.html file for the virtual host created for the site. In the following
example, the path is /www/virtualhosts/starlord.gpavks.com/.
Arcoraci 6 Spring 2245
$ firewall-cmd –-zone=public –-add-service=http –permanent
$ firewall-cmd --reload
d. Navigate to the /www/virtualhosts/starlord.gpavks.com directory and create a simple index.html file for testing
purposes, or use the files provided in myCourses.
e. Restart the httpd service and verify that the virtual host works.
f. Repeat steps, b through e, for the second virtual host. The instructions
use gamora.gpavks.com for the second virtual host.
g. Finally, we need to create the default site, after all we want a default
site in case something goes wrong with the virtual hosts. To do this,
create a third configuration file in the /etc/httpd/conf.d directory. The
file name must be, “_default_.conf”. No typos, it is underscore,
followed by “default, and another underscore.
h. The statements in the directive are similar to the virtual hosts; except
that the DocumentRoot is /var/www/html.
i. For a quick test to verify that the three sites work on the local server, you can add entries to the /etc/hosts file (see
Figure 6 for an example). All the sites will point to server IP address, or you can use the loopback.
Figure 6 – Example Hosts Configuration File
j. Ideally, we want to access the sites remotely. First we need to create a firewall rule to allow incoming HTTP traffic
on the web server. And then reload firewalld.
k. Next, on Windows Server 2022, create aliases on the DNS server for each site. To do this, go to the Server Manager
Dashboard and select Tools
 DNS to launch the DNS Manager (Figure 7). Notice that three aliases are created for
the two virtual hosts and one for the default. This is done by creating CNAME resource records.
Figure 7 – DNS Manager
Arcoraci 7 Spring 2245
DNS Configuration Recap
• Create a host record to map the hostname of the web server to its associated IP address (1). This may have
been done in Lab 2. Referring to Figure 7, hostname web01 maps to the IP address 192.168.100.8.
• Map the default website using “www” as the DNS prefix (2), so when someone types in www.yourdomain.com,
it directs them to the default website. The is mapped to the FQDN of the web server.
• Map the two virtual sites to their respective DNS prefixes (3 & 4), starlord and gamora respectively. Again, both
of these are mapped to the FQDN of the web server.
• Using Figure 7 as an example, the default site is www.gpavks.com, and the other sites, starlord.gpavks.com and
gamora.gpavks.com are associated to their respective sites but they all resolve to the FQDN of the web server,
and the FQDN of the web server maps to its IP address.
Arcoraci 8 Spring 2245
For the report, include four screenshots.
1. The DNS configuration from Windows Server 2022. The screenshot must show the correct configurations for
the following.
a. The A resource record that maps the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or the web server.
b. The CNAME resource record that maps the default site to the FQDN of the web server.
c. The CNAME resource record that maps one of the virtual hosts to the FQDN of the web server.
d. The CNAME resource record that maps the other virtual host to the FQDN of the web server.
To validate the DNS CNAME resource record configuration, you must include a screenshot showing the records
as they appear in the DNS manager. In the same screenshot, use the Windows Command Prompt, and show
the output from the ipconfig command and nslookup on the web server. Refer to Figure 13 for an example.
Figure 8 – Example DNS Configuration
Arcoraci 11 Spring 2245
$ dnf install openssl -y
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.key 2048

Activity 3 – Creating a Self-Signed Certificate
The next two activities focus on securing the web server. For this activity, you will create a self-signed certificate. The
client uses the certificate to validate the authenticity of the web server and encrypt HTTP communications between
itself and the server. Activity 4 will configure Apache to use Transport Layer Security.
a. Log into the web server as root.
b. As a reminder, SELinux can be disabled or set to permissive mode.
c. You may need to install OpenSSL, depending on the version of Rocky it may already be installed, you can check with
the following command, rpm -qa openssl. Otherwise, install using the following command.
d. Next, as root, create the private key using the following command. Be mindful of what directory you are in when
the key is created, because that is the directory that it will reside. These instructions use the directory
/etc/pki/tls/private.
e. You will be prompted for a pass phrase for the key. Enter a passphrase, and commit to memory!
f. To view the key, use the cat command.
Figure 12 – Example RSA Private Key
g. Next, create the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) which is used to (you guessed it), sign your certificate. When
prompted enter the following information. These instruction store the
$ openssl req -key private.key -new -out server.csr
Country: US
• State: New York
• Locality: Rochester
• Company: RIT
• Organizational Unit: NSSA221
• FQDN of the web server: web01.gpavks.com
• Email: me@me.com
• Challenge Password: <you decide>
• Optional Company Name: RIT
Figure 13 – Sample CSR Configuration
h. Next, create the Self-Signed Certificate. This certificate will be used to encrypt the HTTP traffic. Using the CSR and
private key created in the previous steps enter the following command. These instructions create the certificate in
the /etc/pki/tls/certs directory. Please note that the command is a single line.
i. Upon completion of the command, you will be prompted to enter the pass phrase for the private key (hope you
remembered it!). Once complete the output will look similar to Figure 14.
Figure 14 – Certificate Creation
$ openssl req -key private.key -new -out server.csr
Arcoraci 13 Spring 2245
$ dnf -y install mod_ssl
For the report, use the following command to show the contents of the certificate in plain text, openssl x509 -text -
noout -in server.crt. Make sure to include the hostname and date. Figure 15 provides sample output.
Figure 15 – Certificate Verification Example

Activity 4 – Configuring Apache for Transport Layer Security
Now that we have the certificate, the next step is to configure the Apache server for TLS. All examples in this activity
will use the following FQDN for the web server, web01.gpavks.com.
a. First, we need to install the required Apache modules.
Arcoraci 14 Spring 2245
b. Navigate to the /etc/httpd/conf.d/ directory and locate the ssl.conf file. This file contains the information needed to
create the secure virtual host. Before moving on to the next steps look at some of the statements in the file that are
relevant to the exercise (steps c through e).
c. Figure 16 shows the directive that uses port 443 for HTTPS.
Figure 16 – SSL Port
d. Figure 17 shows the statements that define the default virtual host configuration settings; we do not need to
change the information because it is already set up in the global configuration of the httpd.conf file. For this
activity, you will use the default virtual host from the previous exercise whose index.html file is located in
/var/www/html.
Figure 17 – Default Virtual Host
Arcoraci 15 Spring 2245
e. Now we get to the important stuff. This section of the SSL configuration file tells the http daemon service the
location of the private key and the self-signed certificate created in the previous activity. You will need to edit the
file for the location of the key and certificate on your server. The screenshot shows the default locations.
Figure 18 – Certificate and Key Default Location
f. Next, create the secure virtual host in the /etc/httpd/conf.d/ directory. Using a text editor create a file for the
secure virtual host and give it a descriptive name, for example, “webserver_ssl.yourid.com.conf”. Figure 19 provides
a sample configuration file; the statements should be familiar to you with the exception of the SSLEngine,
SSLCertifcateFile, and SSLCertificateKeyFile. As always, for more information you can refer to the Apache
documentation.
Figure 19 – Sample Secure Virtual Host File
Figure 20 – Apache Documentation for SSL/TLS Encryption
Arcoraci 16 Spring 2245
g. Next, restart the http daemon process. Assuming you configured correctly a passphrase for the key will need to be
entered when the service restarts.
Figure 21 – Enter Key Passphrase
h. Using the browser on the local server, enter https://localhost (“s” in bold for emphasis). The site will inform you
that the connection is a potential security risk (Figure 22).
i. Click the “Advanced” button (Figure 22).
Figure 22 – Warning
j. To retrieve the self-signed certificate from the server, click the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button (Figure 23).
Arcoraci 17 Spring 2245
Figure 23 – Accept Risk
k. This will launch the secure site (Figure 24).
Figure 24 – Secure Virtual Site
Arcoraci 18 Spring 2245
For the report, two screenshots are needed. The first screenshot must show that the secure site loads correctly
(Figure 24). The second is a single screenshot showing your FQDN, and the output from the hostname –I
command, and the ls -l command for the file that you created for the secure virtual host. In the same
screenshot, use the cat command to show the contents of the file. The diagram must be a single screen shot
properly labelled and included in the report. Refer to Figure 25 for an example.
Figure 25 – Example Screenshot for SSL Virtual Host Validation

Activity 5 – Installing and Configuring MailEnable
In this activity, you're tasked with setting up and configuring a mail server within your infrastructure. This process will
involve using MailEnable, a free mail server software, which you'll install on Windows Server 2022. MailEnable will serve
dual roles as both the Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) and the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA). This means it will handle both
SMTP and IMAP traffic.
Subsequently, you'll need to install the Mail User Agent (MUA), which is the client software, on Windows 10 and Rocky
Linux. Your task also includes creating two mailboxes and sending an email from one user to another.
Once you have everything set up and functional, your final task will be to capture and analyze email traffic. This process
is crucial for understanding the active protocols and learning the intricacies of email communication.
a. Deploy a new instance of Windows Server 2022. You will need to run the sysprep utility because it has the same
Security ID as the Windows Server in your deployment (see Figure 26).
Arcoraci 19 Spring 2245
Figure 26 – Sysprep Procedure
b. After the system reboots, give it a meaningful hostname (i.e., something that will identify it as the mail server).
Configure static network settings. Make sure to join the server to the domain using a domain admin account.
c. Update your DNS with an MX and A records for the mail server.
d. Using the “Add Roles and Features Wizard,” install Web Server (IIS) and add the
default features. This is a prerequisite for MailEnable.
e. Using the following URL – https://www.mailenable.com, download and install the
free Standard Edition. You DO NOT need to register to download MailEnable.
Figure 27 – MailEnable Standard Edition
Arcoraci 20 Spring 2245
f. During the installation, unless otherwise noted select the default settings.
g. You can read the installation note (but you probably won’t).
Figure 28 – Installation Note
h. When prompted input a name and the company (make it up), and click Next.
Figure 29 – Installation Settings
i. Hit Next a bunch of times until you get to “Get Postoffice Details.” The Post Office Name field will be populated with
your domain (not mine, like Figure 30). And enter a password, then hit Next.
Arcoraci 21 Spring 2245
Figure 30 – Post Office Details
j. Hit next a couple more times and verify that the information in the SMTP Connector Configuration is correct. Again,
it should be your domain, and DNS information, not what’s in the image (the image just for reference).
Figure 31 – Example SMTP Connector Configuration
k. Hit next a couple more times, until you come to the “Select Webmail Web Root,” windows. Make sure that the box
is checked and the default web site is selected (it’s recommended!). If not, that means you did not install the Web
Server IIS role (shame on you ��).
Arcoraci 22 Spring 2245
Figure 32 - Webmail Web Root
l. Hit Next again and wait....BE PATIENT.... while the install completes.
Figure 33 – YAWN!
j. Hit Next again and then Finish.
Arcoraci 23 Spring 2245
Figure 34 – Installation Complete
k. When your done lots of stuff with your web browser is going to happen, just ignore it and close your browser.
l. You can find MailEnable in your programs list (Figure 34), select it to open the program.
Figure 34 – MailEnable (in program list)
Arcoraci 24 Spring 2245
m. Next, we need to create a couple mail boxes. To do this, from the MailEnable Management menu, expand
“Messaging Manager,” then “Post Offices,” select your domain and on the right under Actions, select Create
Mailbox.
Figure 35 – Create Mailbox
n. These instructions use starlord and gamora as the mailboxes.
Figure 36 – Sample Mailbox Creation
Arcoraci 25 Spring 2245
o. For reference, Figure 37 shows the mailboxes listed for the post office gpavks.com.
Figure 37 – Mailboxes for gpavks.com

Activity 6 – Email Client Configuration
For this activity, you will configure Linux and Windows email clients. The screenshots and examples provided in this
activity use the Tunderbird for Rocky Linux 8. For Windows 10,
a. Install Thunderbird on Rocky Linux (At this point installing software on Linux should be familiar to you, if not, a quick
Google search should help. Here’s a little hint.
https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/
b. Launch Thunderbird. To add an account, right click on “Local Folders,” and select settings.
Figure 38 - Settings
c. From the “Account Settings” window select “Account Actions” and the “Add Mail Account... ”.
Arcoraci 26 Spring 2245
Figure 39 – Add Account
d. Enter the user information for one of the accounts. (Figure 40). Click Continue.
Figure 40 - Add User Account
e. If you have DNS configured correctly (especially the MX resource record), then Thunderbird will find your mail
server automatically and all you need to do is click Done.
Arcoraci 27 Spring 2245
Figure 41 – Configuration Found
f. If not, you’ll need to do some troubleshooting. By default, Thunderbird uses the FQDN of the mail server. Select
“Manual Configuration,” and check to see if it is using the FQDN, if not enter it. If it is still not connecting try
entering the IP Address of the server, if that works then your issue is with DNS. If not then check firewall settings,
trying pinging the mail server from the client to make sure there is network connectivity. Does DNS resolve to the
correct IP for the mail server (Figure 43)?
Figure 42 – Checking the Mail Servers FQDN
Arcoraci 28 Spring 2245
Figure 43 –Troubleshooting with nslookup and ping
g. Once the correct hostname for the mail server is configured and the ports are populated, click Done. Because we
did not configure Transport Layer Security for the mail server, a warning is shown (Figure 44), check the box “I
understand the risks.” Click “Confirm,” and then “Finish”.
Figure 44 – Warning
Arcoraci 29 Spring 2245
h. If everything goes well, you should see the mailbox and an email notification (Figure 45). To do a quick test, try
sending an email to the user to see if they receive it. Using this as an example, starlord would send an email to
itself.
Figure 45 – Account Notification
i. Now it’s time for you to take charge. Install an MUA on Windows 10 and configure it. There are several free an
open-source mail clients available. You can use Thunderbird, or give another one a try, like eM.
For the report, include two screenshots. The first screenshot will show the email being sent from one client and
received by the other. In these examples, the email is being sent from the Windows client by Gamora (Figure 46),
and received on the Linux client by Starlord (Figure 47).
Figure 46 – Sent Email from Windows Client
Arcoraci 30 Spring 2245
Figure 47 – Received Email on Linux Client

Activity 7 – Capturing Email Network Traffic
For this activity, you will be using Wireshark to capture IMAP and SMTP traffic.
a. Launch Wireshark on the email server.
b. Send an email from one account to another, it does not matter who the sender or the receiver is for this exercise.
c. Capture the traffic and filter for IMAP and SMTP traffic (Figures 48 and 49).
Figure 48 – Example SMTP Network Trace
Arcoraci 31 Spring 2245
Figure 49 – Example IMAP Network Trace
For the report, include screenshots from the email network traces. The traces must show the IP address of the server
and clients involved in the communication and the date/time stamp must be visible. Use the screenshots to explain the
communication that occurs between the client and server when forwarding and receiving the email message. The
explanation must be included with the screenshot, in the report. If you do not explain the communication, you will not
receive credit. The explanation must be in your own words.
You may also follow the TCP stream (Figure 65) and include that screenshot, in addition to the other traces for your
explanation.
Arcoraci 32 Spring 2245
Figure 50 – Example Screenshot of “Following the TCP Stream”
Activity 8 – Remote Logging
Rsyslog serves the purpose of logging and organizing system messages according to specific categories for storage. For
this task, you have the option to either add another Rocky Linux 8 virtual machine to your existing infrastructure
(requiring two virtual machines) or use the ones you already have. One of these devices will act as the centralized log
server responsible for collecting logs, while the other will be responsible for sending the logs to the central server. The
ability to aggregate logs on a central server is vital for most organizations as it greatly simplifies log management.
Moreover, it aligns with NIST recommendations and plays a crucial role in enhancing security, making it an
indispensable component for establishing a robust log management system in an enterprise environment.
a. Select a Rocky Linux VM to be the centralized log server. Again, you can deploy another Rocky VM, or use an
existing one.
b. Update the system and make any necessary configuration changes.
c. You may disable SELinux or set it to permissive mode.
d. By default, rsyslog is installed on Rocky Linux 8; to see the version type rpm -qa rsyslog into the terminal.
e. Next, edit the rsyslog configuration file in /etc/resyslog.conf. Rsyslog can be configured to receive logs via TCP or
UDP. For this activity we’ll configure both.
f. Uncomment the following lines in the file by removing the # symbol.
Arcoraci 33 Spring 2245
$sudo firewall-cmd –-permanent –-add-port=514/tcp
$sudo firewall-cmd –-permanent –-add-port=514/udp
$sudo firewall-cmd --reload
*.* @@<server IP Address or hostname>:514
Figure 51 – Rsyslog Configuration Edit
g. Next, create a firewall rule to allow traffic through the port rsyslog is listening on, which is port 514. In addition,
allow TCP and UDP traffic. Yes, enable the firewall.
h. Restart the rsyslog and firewall services.
i. Next, configure the client to forward logs to the centralized log server. To do this, you will need to edit the rsyslog
configuration file on the client. In the configuration file add the following line to the end of the file.
module(load=”imudp”) # needs to be done just once
input(type=”imudp” port=”514”
module(load=”imtcp”) # needs to be done just once
input(type=”imtcp” port=”514”
Arcoraci 34 Spring 2245
$ tail –f var/log/messages
$ logger This is a test!
j. Figure 52 – Client rsyslog Configuration File
k. Restart rsyslog on the client.
l. Use the following command on the central log server to capture messages.
m. Using the logger command, test to verify that the central log server is receiving messages from the webserver.
Figure 53 – Sample Log
For the report, include a single screenshot showing that the rsyslog server received the message. Refer to Figure 53
for an example. The image must show the hostname of the client and the message.
Arcoraci 35 Spring 2245
Additionally, capture a Wireshark trace of the exchange, for brevity, you can filter using “rsh”. The trace must
include the message and the IP addresses of the client and log server. Refer to Figure 54 for an example.
Figure 54 – Network Trace Example


Activity 9 – The Cron Service
Crond is a daemon process designed for automating tasks, allowing them to run in the background without user
intervention. A "cron job" refers to a scheduled task that executes at specific intervals. To manage these tasks, the main
file used is called the crontab, which instructs the cron daemon on when to run each task. In this context, Figure 55
represents an example of a crontab file typically located in the /etc directory.
Before you proceed with configuring cron jobs, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the file's format. Each user has
their crontab file, which can be found in the /var/spool/cron directory. However, please note that the file for a user is
created only after they run their first cron job.
Figure 55 – Crontab file format
Arcoraci 36 Spring 2245
Example 1:
30 08 10 06 * /home/backups/full-backup.sh
The first example runs the shell script “full-backup.sh”, every June (06), on the tenth day (10) at 8:30am. Note that the
time value is in the 24-hour format, if it was 8:30 PM, the hour would be 20 and not 8. The use of the asterisk means to
run this job every day of the week.
Example 2:
00 11, 16 * * * /home/bin/incremental-backup.py
This example introduces something a little more interesting. The following is a Python script. However, notice the “11,
16” in the hour column, this means to run the job during the 0th minute (00) at 11 AM (11) and 4 PM (16), every day,
every month, and every day of the week.
Now that we have an idea of what information goes into the crontab file how do we go about adding or editing entries
in the file. To add an entry to the crontab file use the crontab –e command as the current user. The user that creates
the job must also be the same user that is the owner of the script.
Please Note: Red Hat recommends that you do not edit /etc/crontab directly! Use the crontab utility!
The following commands provide a summary of the crontab command and some of its options.
crontab –l lists the user’s crontab.
crontab –e edits the user’s crontab.
crontab –r deletes the user’s crontab.
Of course, reviewing the crontab man page will help too.
Create a cron job that uses the logger command to send a message from the client to the central log server every
minute.
For the report, include a screenshot showing the output of the hostname, whoami, and crontab -l commands. See
Figure 56 for an example.
Arcoraci 37 Spring 2245
Figure 56 – Example Cronjob List Validation
Using the tail –f /var/log/messages command, provide a second screenshot showing that the log server
received the message. The screenshot must show at least two instances of the message received with the time stamp
showing a 2-minute interval. It must be the same message that appears in the cronjob list. Refer to Figure 72 for an
example.
